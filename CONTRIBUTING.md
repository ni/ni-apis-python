# Contributing to `ni-apis-python`

Contributions to `ni-apis-python` are welcome from all!

`ni-apis-python` is managed via Git, with the canonical upstream
repository hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/ni/ni-apis-python. This repo
contains a collection of Python packages for [NI's gRPC APIs](https://github.com/ni/ni-apis).

`ni-apis-python` follows a pull-request model for development.  If you wish to
contribute, you will need to create a GitHub account, fork this project, push a
branch with your changes to your project, and then submit a pull request.

Please remember to sign off your commits (e.g., by using `git commit -s` if you
are using the command line client). This amends your Git commit message with a line
of the form `Signed-off-by: Name Lastname <name.lastmail@emailaddress.com>`. Please
include all authors of any given commit into the commit message with a
`Signed-off-by` line. This indicates that you have read and signed the Developer
Certificate of Origin (see below) and are able to legally submit your code to
this repository.

See [GitHub's official documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
for more details.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- _(Optional)_ Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com)
  -  _(Optional)_ Configure git to automatically add the `--recurse-submodules` flag with `git config submodule.recurse true`
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), any version from the [README](README.md)
- Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), version >= 1.8.2

## Clone or update the Git repository

To download the source, clone the Git repository.

```cmd
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ni/ni-apis-python.git
```

Specifying `--recurse-submodules` includes the [ni-apis](https://github.com/ni/ni-apis)
repository. This is required for the [update gRPC stubs](#update-grpc-stubs-if-needed) workflow.

To update the source, you can update the repository and its submodules.

```cmd
git checkout main
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Select a package to develop

This repository includes multiple Python packages. Some examples:
- `ni.protobuf.types`: types used by [NI's gRPC APIs](https://github.com/ni/ni-apis/)
- _(waiting for upload -- AB#3159540)_: APIs used by [`nipanel-python`](https://github.com/ni/nipanel-python)

Open a terminal window and navigate to the package that you selected.

```sh
# Example: APIs used by nipanel-python
cd packages\(waiting for upload -- AB#3159540)
```

## Install the package and its dependencies

From the package's subdirectory, run the [`poetry install`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#install)
command. This creates an in-project virtual environment (`.venv`) and installs
the package's dependencies and dev-dependencies, as specified in its
`pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files.

```cmd
poetry install
```

## Activate the virtual environment (if needed)

- _(Recommended)_ Activate for each command by prefixing the call with `poetry run {command}`
- Activate for the lifetime of the shell in the terminal with `poetry shell`
- Activate in VS Code ([link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment))

# Simple Development Loop

```sh
# Update from main
git checkout main
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Create a new branch
git switch --create users/{username}/{branch-purpose}

# Select and package and install its dependencies
# Example: APIs used by nipanel-python
cd packages\(waiting for upload -- AB#3159540)
poetry install

# ‚úç Make source changes

# Run the analyzers -- see files in .github/workflows for details
poetry run nps lint
poetry run mypy
poetry run pyright

# Apply safe fixes
poetry run nps fix

# Run the tests
poetry run pytest -v
```

# Update gRPC Stubs (If Needed)

Each package in this repository contains Python files generated from the
matching protobuf (`.proto`) package in the `ni-apis` Git submodule. These
Python files must be regenerated whenever the `.proto` files change.

To regenerate the Python files for a package, run the code generator on its directory.

```sh
# Example: APIs used by nipanel-python
(waiting for upload -- AB#3159540)
```

To preview in-work `.proto` file changes, (waiting for upload -- AB#3159540).

# Publishing Packages

You can publish one of the packages in the `packages` folder by creating a GitHub release
in the ni-apis-python repo. Here are the steps to follow to publish a package:

1. From the main GitHub repo page, select "Create a new release".
2. On the "New Release" page, create a new tag using the "Select Tag" drop down. The tag must be in the
format `<package-name>/<package-version>` where `package-name` and `package-version` match the
values found in pyproject.toml. Example: `ni.protobuf.types/0.1.0-dev0`.
3. Enter a title in the "Release title" field. The title should contain the package name and
version in the format `<package-name> <package-version>`. For example: `ni.protobuf.types 0.1.0-dev0`.
4. Click "Generate release notes" and edit the release notes.
  - Delete entries for PRs that do not affect users, such as "chore(deps):" and "fix(deps):" PRs.
  - Consider grouping related entries.
  - Reformat entries to be more readable. For example, change "Blah blah by so-and-so in \#123" to "Blah blah (\#123)".
5. If this is a pre-release release, check the "Set as a pre-release" checkbox.
6. Click "Publish release".
7. Creating a release will start the publish workflow. You can track the
progress of this workflow in the "Actions" page of the GitHub repo.
8. The workflow job that publishes a package to pypi requires code owner approval. This job will automatically send code owners a notification email, then it will wait for them to log in and approve the deployment.
9. After receiving code owner approval, the publish workflow will resume.
10. Once the publish workflow has finished, you should see your release on pypi.
