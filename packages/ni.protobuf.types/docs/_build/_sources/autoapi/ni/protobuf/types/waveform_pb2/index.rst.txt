.. py:class:: DoubleAnalogWaveform(*, t0 = ..., dt = ..., y_data = ..., attributes = ...)

   Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`


   A double-precision analog waveform with timing and extended properties.


   .. py:attribute:: DESCRIPTOR
      :type:  google.protobuf.descriptor.Descriptor


   .. py:class:: AttributesEntry(*, key = ..., value = ...)

      Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`


      Abstract base class for protocol messages.

      Protocol message classes are almost always generated by the protocol
      compiler.  These generated types subclass Message and implement the methods
      shown below.


      .. py:attribute:: DESCRIPTOR
         :type:  google.protobuf.descriptor.Descriptor

         :type: global___WaveformAttributeValue



      .. py:method:: __init__(*, key = ..., value = ...)


      .. py:method:: HasField(field_name)

         Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

         For a oneof group, checks if any field inside is set. Note that if the
         field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, :exc:`ValueError` will
         be raised.

         :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.
         :type field_name: str

         :returns: Whether a value has been set for the named field.
         :rtype: bool

         :raises ValueError: if the `field_name` is not a member of this message.



      .. py:method:: ClearField(field_name)

         Clears the contents of a given field.

         Inside a oneof group, clears the field set. If the name neither refers to a
         defined field or oneof group, :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

         :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.
         :type field_name: str

         :raises ValueError: if the `field_name` is not a member of this message.



      .. py:attribute:: __slots__
         :value: []



      .. py:method:: __deepcopy__(memo=None)


      .. py:method:: __dir__()

         Provides the list of all accessible Message attributes.



      .. py:method:: __eq__(other_msg)
         :abstractmethod:


         Recursively compares two messages by value and structure.



      .. py:method:: __ne__(other_msg)


      .. py:method:: __hash__()


      .. py:method:: __str__()
         :abstractmethod:


         Outputs a human-readable representation of the message.



      .. py:method:: __unicode__()
         :abstractmethod:


         Outputs a human-readable representation of the message.



      .. py:method:: __contains__(field_name_or_key)
         :abstractmethod:


         Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

         Has presence fields return true if the field is set, false if the field is
         not set. Fields without presence do raise `ValueError` (this includes
         repeated fields, map fields, and implicit presence fields).

         If field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, `ValueError` will
         be raised.
         Note: WKT Struct checks if the key is contained in fields. ListValue checks
         if the item is contained in the list.

         :param field_name_or_key: For Struct, the key (str) of the fields map. For
                                   ListValue, any type that may be contained in the list. For other
                                   messages, name of the field (str) to check for presence.

         :returns:

                   For Struct, whether the item is contained in fields. For ListValue,
                         whether the item is contained in the list. For other message,
                         whether a value has been set for the named field.
         :rtype: bool

         :raises ValueError: For normal messages,  if the `field_name_or_key` is not a
             member of this message or `field_name_or_key` is not a string.



      .. py:method:: MergeFrom(other_msg)
         :abstractmethod:


         Merges the contents of the specified message into current message.

         This method merges the contents of the specified message into the current
         message. Singular fields that are set in the specified message overwrite
         the corresponding fields in the current message. Repeated fields are
         appended. Singular sub-messages and groups are recursively merged.

         :param other_msg: A message to merge into the current message.
         :type other_msg: Message



      .. py:method:: CopyFrom(other_msg)

         Copies the content of the specified message into the current message.

         The method clears the current message and then merges the specified
         message using MergeFrom.

         :param other_msg: A message to copy into the current one.
         :type other_msg: Message



      .. py:method:: Clear()
         :abstractmethod:


         Clears all data that was set in the message.



      .. py:method:: SetInParent()
         :abstractmethod:


         Mark this as present in the parent.

         This normally happens automatically when you assign a field of a
         sub-message, but sometimes you want to make the sub-message
         present while keeping it empty.  If you find yourself using this,
         you may want to reconsider your design.



      .. py:method:: IsInitialized()
         :abstractmethod:


         Checks if the message is initialized.

         :returns: The method returns True if the message is initialized (i.e. all of
                   its required fields are set).
         :rtype: bool



      .. py:method:: MergeFromString(serialized)
         :abstractmethod:


         Merges serialized protocol buffer data into this message.

         When we find a field in `serialized` that is already present
         in this message:

         -   If it's a "repeated" field, we append to the end of our list.
         -   Else, if it's a scalar, we overwrite our field.
         -   Else, (it's a nonrepeated composite), we recursively merge
             into the existing composite.

         :param serialized: Any object that allows us to call
                            ``memoryview(serialized)`` to access a string of bytes using the
                            buffer interface.
         :type serialized: bytes

         :returns: The number of bytes read from `serialized`.
                   For non-group messages, this will always be `len(serialized)`,
                   but for messages which are actually groups, this will
                   generally be less than `len(serialized)`, since we must
                   stop when we reach an ``END_GROUP`` tag.  Note that if
                   we *do* stop because of an ``END_GROUP`` tag, the number
                   of bytes returned does not include the bytes
                   for the ``END_GROUP`` tag information.
         :rtype: int

         :raises DecodeError: if the input cannot be parsed.



      .. py:method:: ParseFromString(serialized)

         Parse serialized protocol buffer data in binary form into this message.

         Like :func:`MergeFromString()`, except we clear the object first.

         :raises message.DecodeError if the input cannot be parsed.:



      .. py:method:: SerializeToString(**kwargs)
         :abstractmethod:


         Serializes the protocol message to a binary string.

         :keyword deterministic: If true, requests deterministic serialization
                                 of the protobuf, with predictable ordering of map keys.
         :kwtype deterministic: bool

         :returns: A binary string representation of the message if all of the required
                   fields in the message are set (i.e. the message is initialized).

         :raises EncodeError: if the message isn't initialized (see :func:`IsInitialized`).



      .. py:method:: SerializePartialToString(**kwargs)
         :abstractmethod:


         Serializes the protocol message to a binary string.

         This method is similar to SerializeToString but doesn't check if the
         message is initialized.

         :keyword deterministic: If true, requests deterministic serialization
                                 of the protobuf, with predictable ordering of map keys.
         :kwtype deterministic: bool

         :returns: A serialized representation of the partial message.
         :rtype: bytes



      .. py:method:: ListFields()
         :abstractmethod:


         Returns a list of (FieldDescriptor, value) tuples for present fields.

         A message field is non-empty if HasField() would return true. A singular
         primitive field is non-empty if HasField() would return true in proto2 or it
         is non zero in proto3. A repeated field is non-empty if it contains at least
         one element. The fields are ordered by field number.

         :returns: field descriptors and values
                   for all fields in the message which are not empty. The values vary by
                   field type.
         :rtype: list[tuple(FieldDescriptor, value)]



      .. py:method:: WhichOneof(oneof_group)
         :abstractmethod:


         Returns the name of the field that is set inside a oneof group.

         If no field is set, returns None.

         :param oneof_group: the name of the oneof group to check.
         :type oneof_group: str

         :returns: The name of the group that is set, or None.
         :rtype: str or None

         :raises ValueError: no group with the given name exists



      .. py:method:: HasExtension(field_descriptor)
         :abstractmethod:


         Checks if a certain extension is present for this message.

         Extensions are retrieved using the :attr:`Extensions` mapping (if present).

         :param field_descriptor: The field descriptor for the extension to check.

         :returns: Whether the extension is present for this message.
         :rtype: bool

         :raises KeyError: if the extension is repeated. Similar to repeated fields,
             there is no separate notion of presence: a "not present" repeated
             extension is an empty list.



      .. py:method:: ClearExtension(field_descriptor)
         :abstractmethod:


         Clears the contents of a given extension.

         :param field_descriptor: The field descriptor for the extension to clear.



      .. py:method:: UnknownFields()
         :abstractmethod:


         Returns the UnknownFieldSet.

         :returns: The unknown fields stored in this message.
         :rtype: UnknownFieldSet



      .. py:method:: DiscardUnknownFields()
         :abstractmethod:


         Clears all fields in the :class:`UnknownFieldSet`.

         This operation is recursive for nested message.



      .. py:method:: ByteSize()
         :abstractmethod:


         Returns the serialized size of this message.

         Recursively calls ByteSize() on all contained messages.

         :returns: The number of bytes required to serialize this message.
         :rtype: int



      .. py:method:: FromString(s)
         :classmethod:

         :abstractmethod:



      .. py:method:: _SetListener(message_listener)
         :abstractmethod:


         Internal method used by the protocol message implementation.
         Clients should not call this directly.

         Sets a listener that this message will call on certain state transitions.

         The purpose of this method is to register back-edges from children to
         parents at runtime, for the purpose of setting "has" bits and
         byte-size-dirty bits in the parent and ancestor objects whenever a child or
         descendant object is modified.

         If the client wants to disconnect this Message from the object tree, she
         explicitly sets callback to None.

         If message_listener is None, unregisters any existing listener.  Otherwise,
         message_listener must implement the MessageListener interface in
         internal/message_listener.py, and we discard any listener registered
         via a previous _SetListener() call.



      .. py:method:: __getstate__()

   .. py:method:: __init__(*, t0 = ..., dt = ..., y_data = ..., attributes = ...)


   .. py:method:: HasField(field_name)

      Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

      For a oneof group, checks if any field inside is set. Note that if the
      field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, :exc:`ValueError` will
      be raised.

      :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.
      :type field_name: str

      :returns: Whether a value has been set for the named field.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises ValueError: if the `field_name` is not a member of this message.



   .. py:method:: ClearField(field_name)

      Clears the contents of a given field.

      Inside a oneof group, clears the field set. If the name neither refers to a
      defined field or oneof group, :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

      :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.

   .. py:method:: __contains__(field_name_or_key)
      :abstractmethod:


      Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

      Has presence fields return true if the field is set, false if the field is
      not set. Fields without presence do raise `ValueError` (this includes
      repeated fields, map fields, and implicit presence fields).

      If field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, `ValueError` will
      be raised.
      Note: WKT Struct checks if the key is contained in fields. ListValue checks
      if the item is contained in the list.

      :param field_name_or_key: For Struct, the key (str) of the fields map. For
                                ListValue, any type that may be contained in the list. For other

   .. py:method:: _SetListener(message_listener)
      :abstractmethod:


      Internal method used by the protocol message implementation.
      Clients should not call this directly.

      Sets a listener that this message will call on certain state transitions.

      The purpose of this method is to register back-edges from children to
      parents at runtime, for the purpose of setting "has" bits and
      byte-size-dirty bits in the parent and ancestor objects whenever a child or
      descendant object is modified.

      If the client wants to disconnect this Message from the object tree, she
      explicitly sets callback to None.

      If message_listener is None, unregisters any existing listener.  Otherwise,
      message_listener must implement the MessageListener interface in
      internal/message_listener.py, and we discard any listener registered
      via a previous _SetListener() call.

         Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

         Has presence fields return true if the field is set, false if the field is
         not set. Fields without presence do raise `ValueError` (this includes
         repeated fields, map fields, and implicit presence fields).

         If field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, `ValueError` will
         be raised.
         Note: WKT Struct checks if the key is contained in fields. ListValue checks
         if the item is contained in the list.

         :param field_name_or_key: For Struct, the key (str) of the fields map. For

         Merges the contents of the specified message into current message.

         This method merges the contents of the specified message into the current
         message. Singular fields that are set in the specified message overwrite
         the corresponding fields in the current message. Repeated fields are
         appended. Singular sub-messages and groups are recursively merged.

      .. py:method:: SetInParent()
         :abstractmethod:


         Mark this as present in the parent.

         This normally happens automatically when you assign a field of a
         sub-message, but sometimes you want to make the sub-message
         present while keeping it empty.  If you find yourself using this,
         you may want to reconsider your design.



      .. py:method:: IsInitialized()
         :abstractmethod:


         Checks if the message is initialized.

         :returns: The method returns True if the message is initialized (i.e. all of

         :rtype: bool



      .. py:method:: MergeFromString(serialized)
         :abstractmethod:


         Merges serialized protocol buffer data into this message.

         When we find a field in `serialized` that is already present
         in this message:

         -   If it's a "repeated" field, we append to the end of our list.
         -   Else, if it's a scalar, we overwrite our field.
         -   Else, (it's a nonrepeated composite), we recursively merge
             into the existing composite.

         :type serialized: bytes

         :returns: The number of bytes read from `serialized`.
                   For non-group messages, this will always be `len(serialized)`,
                   but for messages which are actually groups, this will
                   generally be less than `len(serialized)`, since we must
                   stop when we reach an ``END_GROUP`` tag.  Note that if
                   we *do* stop because of an ``END_GROUP`` tag, the number
                   of bytes returned does not include the bytes
                   for the ``END_GROUP`` tag information.
         :rtype: int

         :raises EncodeError: if the message isn't initialized (see :func:`IsInitialized`).



      .. py:method:: SerializePartialToString(**kwargs)
         :abstractmethod:


         Serializes the protocol message to a binary string.

         This method is similar to SerializeToString but doesn't check if the
         message is initialized.

         :keyword deterministic: If true, requests deterministic serialization
                                 of the protobuf, with predictable ordering of map keys.

         primitive field is non-empty if HasField() would return true in proto2 or it
         is non zero in proto3. A repeated field is non-empty if it contains at least
         one element. The fields are ordered by field number.

         :returns: field descriptors and values
                   for all fields in the message which are not empty. The values vary by

      A message field is non-empty if HasField() would return true. A singular
      primitive field is non-empty if HasField() would return true in proto2 or it
      is non zero in proto3. A repeated field is non-empty if it contains at least
      one element. The fields are ordered by field number.

      :returns: field descriptors and values
                for all fields in the message which are not empty. The values vary by

      Checks if a certain extension is present for this message.

      Extensions are retrieved using the :attr:`Extensions` mapping (if present).

      :param field_descriptor: The field descriptor for the extension to check.

      :returns: Whether the extension is present for this message.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises KeyError: if the extension is repeated. Similar to repeated fields,

   .. py:method:: _SetListener(message_listener)
      :abstractmethod:


      Internal method used by the protocol message implementation.
      Clients should not call this directly.

      Sets a listener that this message will call on certain state transitions.

      The purpose of this method is to register back-edges from children to
      parents at runtime, for the purpose of setting "has" bits and
      byte-size-dirty bits in the parent and ancestor objects whenever a child or
      descendant object is modified.

      If the client wants to disconnect this Message from the object tree, she
      explicitly sets callback to None.

      If message_listener is None, unregisters any existing listener.  Otherwise,
      message_listener must implement the MessageListener interface in
      internal/message_listener.py, and we discard any listener registered
      via a previous _SetListener() call.

         Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

         For a oneof group, checks if any field inside is set. Note that if the
         field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, :exc:`ValueError` will
         be raised.

         Clears the contents of a given field.

         Inside a oneof group, clears the field set. If the name neither refers to a
         defined field or oneof group, :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

         :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.

      .. py:method:: __contains__(field_name_or_key)
         :abstractmethod:


         Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

         Has presence fields return true if the field is set, false if the field is
         not set. Fields without presence do raise `ValueError` (this includes
         repeated fields, map fields, and implicit presence fields).

         If field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, `ValueError` will
         be raised.
         Note: WKT Struct checks if the key is contained in fields. ListValue checks
         if the item is contained in the list.

         :param field_name_or_key: For Struct, the key (str) of the fields map. For
                                   ListValue, any type that may be contained in the list. For other

         Merges the contents of the specified message into current message.

         This method merges the contents of the specified message into the current
         message. Singular fields that are set in the specified message overwrite
         the corresponding fields in the current message. Repeated fields are
         appended. Singular sub-messages and groups are recursively merged.

         :param other_msg: A message to merge into the current message.
         :type other_msg: Message



      .. py:method:: CopyFrom(other_msg)

         Copies the content of the specified message into the current message.

         The method clears the current message and then merges the specified

      .. py:method:: SetInParent()
         :abstractmethod:


         Mark this as present in the parent.

         This normally happens automatically when you assign a field of a
         sub-message, but sometimes you want to make the sub-message
         present while keeping it empty.  If you find yourself using this,
         you may want to reconsider your design.



      .. py:method:: IsInitialized()
         :abstractmethod:


         Checks if the message is initialized.

      .. py:method:: MergeFromString(serialized)
         :abstractmethod:


         Merges serialized protocol buffer data into this message.

         When we find a field in `serialized` that is already present
         in this message:

         -   If it's a "repeated" field, we append to the end of our list.
         -   Else, if it's a scalar, we overwrite our field.

         :type serialized: bytes

         :returns: The number of bytes read from `serialized`.
                   For non-group messages, this will always be `len(serialized)`,
                   but for messages which are actually groups, this will
                   generally be less than `len(serialized)`, since we must
                   stop when we reach an ``END_GROUP`` tag.  Note that if
                   we *do* stop because of an ``END_GROUP`` tag, the number

   .. py:method:: SetInParent()
      :abstractmethod:


      Mark this as present in the parent.

      This normally happens automatically when you assign a field of a

      you may want to reconsider your design.



   .. py:method:: IsInitialized()
      :abstractmethod:


      Checks if the message is initialized.

      :returns: The method returns True if the message is initialized (i.e. all of

      :rtype: bool



   .. py:method:: MergeFromString(serialized)
      :abstractmethod:


      Merges serialized protocol buffer data into this message.

      When we find a field in `serialized` that is already present
      in this message:

      -   If it's a "repeated" field, we append to the end of our list.
      -   Else, if it's a scalar, we overwrite our field.
      -   Else, (it's a nonrepeated composite), we recursively merge
          into the existing composite.

      :param serialized: Any object that allows us to call
                         ``memoryview(serialized)`` to access a string of bytes using the
                         buffer interface.
      :type serialized: bytes

      :returns: The number of bytes read from `serialized`.
                For non-group messages, this will always be `len(serialized)`,
                but for messages which are actually groups, this will
                generally be less than `len(serialized)`, since we must
                stop when we reach an ``END_GROUP`` tag.  Note that if
                we *do* stop because of an ``END_GROUP`` tag, the number
                of bytes returned does not include the bytes
                for the ``END_GROUP`` tag information.
      :rtype: int

      :raises DecodeError: if the input cannot be parsed.



   .. py:method:: ParseFromString(serialized)

      Parse serialized protocol buffer data in binary form into this message.

   .. py:method:: ListFields()
      :abstractmethod:


      Returns a list of (FieldDescriptor, value) tuples for present fields.

      A message field is non-empty if HasField() would return true. A singular
      primitive field is non-empty if HasField() would return true in proto2 or it
      is non zero in proto3. A repeated field is non-empty if it contains at least
      one element. The fields are ordered by field number.

      :returns: field descriptors and values
                for all fields in the message which are not empty. The values vary by

      :raises ValueError: no group with the given name exists



   .. py:method:: HasExtension(field_descriptor)
      :abstractmethod:


      Checks if a certain extension is present for this message.

      Extensions are retrieved using the :attr:`Extensions` mapping (if present).

      :param field_descriptor: The field descriptor for the extension to check.

      :returns: Whether the extension is present for this message.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises KeyError: if the extension is repeated. Similar to repeated fields,
          there is no separate notion of presence: a "not present" repeated
          extension is an empty list.



   .. py:method:: ClearExtension(field_descriptor)

   .. py:method:: _SetListener(message_listener)
      :abstractmethod:


      Internal method used by the protocol message implementation.
      Clients should not call this directly.

      Sets a listener that this message will call on certain state transitions.

      The purpose of this method is to register back-edges from children to
      parents at runtime, for the purpose of setting "has" bits and
      byte-size-dirty bits in the parent and ancestor objects whenever a child or
      descendant object is modified.

      If the client wants to disconnect this Message from the object tree, she
      explicitly sets callback to None.

      If message_listener is None, unregisters any existing listener.  Otherwise,
      message_listener must implement the MessageListener interface in
      internal/message_listener.py, and we discard any listener registered
      via a previous _SetListener() call.

         Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

         For a oneof group, checks if any field inside is set. Note that if the
         field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, :exc:`ValueError` will
         be raised.

         :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.

         Clears the contents of a given field.

         Inside a oneof group, clears the field set. If the name neither refers to a
         defined field or oneof group, :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

         :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.

      .. py:method:: __contains__(field_name_or_key)
         :abstractmethod:


         Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

         Has presence fields return true if the field is set, false if the field is
         not set. Fields without presence do raise `ValueError` (this includes
         repeated fields, map fields, and implicit presence fields).

         If field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, `ValueError` will
         be raised.
         Note: WKT Struct checks if the key is contained in fields. ListValue checks
         if the item is contained in the list.

         :param field_name_or_key: For Struct, the key (str) of the fields map. For

      not set. Fields without presence do raise `ValueError` (this includes
      repeated fields, map fields, and implicit presence fields).

      If field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, `ValueError` will

      :abstractmethod:


      Merges the contents of the specified message into current message.

      This method merges the contents of the specified message into the current
      message. Singular fields that are set in the specified message overwrite
      the corresponding fields in the current message. Repeated fields are
      appended. Singular sub-messages and groups are recursively merged.

      :param other_msg: A message to merge into the current message.
      :type other_msg: Message



   .. py:method:: CopyFrom(other_msg)

      Copies the content of the specified message into the current message.

      The method clears the current message and then merges the specified

      :abstractmethod:


      Clears all data that was set in the message.



   .. py:method:: SetInParent()
      :abstractmethod:


      Mark this as present in the parent.

      This normally happens automatically when you assign a field of a
      sub-message, but sometimes you want to make the sub-message
      present while keeping it empty.  If you find yourself using this,
      you may want to reconsider your design.



   .. py:method:: IsInitialized()
      :abstractmethod:


      Checks if the message is initialized.

      :returns: The method returns True if the message is initialized (i.e. all of
                its required fields are set).
      :rtype: bool



   .. py:method:: MergeFromString(serialized)
      :abstractmethod:


      Merges serialized protocol buffer data into this message.

      When we find a field in `serialized` that is already present
      in this message:

      -   If it's a "repeated" field, we append to the end of our list.
      -   Else, if it's a scalar, we overwrite our field.
      -   Else, (it's a nonrepeated composite), we recursively merge
          into the existing composite.

      :param serialized: Any object that allows us to call
                         ``memoryview(serialized)`` to access a string of bytes using the
                         buffer interface.
      :type serialized: bytes

      :returns: The number of bytes read from `serialized`.
                For non-group messages, this will always be `len(serialized)`,
                but for messages which are actually groups, this will
                generally be less than `len(serialized)`, since we must
                stop when we reach an ``END_GROUP`` tag.  Note that if
                we *do* stop because of an ``END_GROUP`` tag, the number
                of bytes returned does not include the bytes
                for the ``END_GROUP`` tag information.
      :rtype: int

      :raises DecodeError: if the input cannot be parsed.



   .. py:method:: ParseFromString(serialized)

      Parse serialized protocol buffer data in binary form into this message.

      Like :func:`MergeFromString()`, except we clear the object first.

      :raises message.DecodeError if the input cannot be parsed.:

      :returns: A binary string representation of the message if all of the required
                fields in the message are set (i.e. the message is initialized).

      :raises EncodeError: if the message isn't initialized (see :func:`IsInitialized`).



   .. py:method:: SerializePartialToString(**kwargs)
      :abstractmethod:


      Serializes the protocol message to a binary string.

      This method is similar to SerializeToString but doesn't check if the

      :rtype: bytes



   .. py:method:: ListFields()
      :abstractmethod:


      Returns a list of (FieldDescriptor, value) tuples for present fields.

      A message field is non-empty if HasField() would return true. A singular
      primitive field is non-empty if HasField() would return true in proto2 or it
      is non zero in proto3. A repeated field is non-empty if it contains at least
      one element. The fields are ordered by field number.

      :returns: field descriptors and values
                for all fields in the message which are not empty. The values vary by
                field type.

      :param oneof_group: the name of the oneof group to check.
      :type oneof_group: str

      :returns: The name of the group that is set, or None.

      :raises ValueError: no group with the given name exists



   .. py:method:: HasExtension(field_descriptor)
      :abstractmethod:


      Checks if a certain extension is present for this message.

      Extensions are retrieved using the :attr:`Extensions` mapping (if present).

      :param field_descriptor: The field descriptor for the extension to check.

      :returns: Whether the extension is present for this message.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises KeyError: if the extension is repeated. Similar to repeated fields,
          there is no separate notion of presence: a "not present" repeated
          extension is an empty list.



   .. py:method:: ClearExtension(field_descriptor)
      :abstractmethod:


      Clears the contents of a given extension.

      :param field_descriptor: The field descriptor for the extension to clear.

   .. py:method:: _SetListener(message_listener)
      :abstractmethod:


      Internal method used by the protocol message implementation.
      Clients should not call this directly.

      Sets a listener that this message will call on certain state transitions.

      The purpose of this method is to register back-edges from children to
      parents at runtime, for the purpose of setting "has" bits and
      byte-size-dirty bits in the parent and ancestor objects whenever a child or
      descendant object is modified.

      If the client wants to disconnect this Message from the object tree, she
      explicitly sets callback to None.

      If message_listener is None, unregisters any existing listener.  Otherwise,
      message_listener must implement the MessageListener interface in
      internal/message_listener.py, and we discard any listener registered
      via a previous _SetListener() call.

   .. py:method:: __contains__(field_name_or_key)
      :abstractmethod:


      Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

      Has presence fields return true if the field is set, false if the field is
      not set. Fields without presence do raise `ValueError` (this includes
      repeated fields, map fields, and implicit presence fields).

      If field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, `ValueError` will
      be raised.
      Note: WKT Struct checks if the key is contained in fields. ListValue checks
      if the item is contained in the list.

      :abstractmethod:


      Merges the contents of the specified message into current message.

      This method merges the contents of the specified message into the current
      message. Singular fields that are set in the specified message overwrite
      the corresponding fields in the current message. Repeated fields are
      appended. Singular sub-messages and groups are recursively merged.

      :param other_msg: A message to merge into the current message.
      :type other_msg: Message



   .. py:method:: CopyFrom(other_msg)

      Copies the content of the specified message into the current message.

      The method clears the current message and then merges the specified

      Clears all data that was set in the message.



   .. py:method:: SetInParent()
      :abstractmethod:


      Mark this as present in the parent.

      This normally happens automatically when you assign a field of a
      sub-message, but sometimes you want to make the sub-message
      present while keeping it empty.  If you find yourself using this,
      you may want to reconsider your design.



   .. py:method:: IsInitialized()
      :abstractmethod:


      Checks if the message is initialized.

      :returns: The method returns True if the message is initialized (i.e. all of
                its required fields are set).
      :rtype: bool



   .. py:method:: MergeFromString(serialized)
      :abstractmethod:


      Merges serialized protocol buffer data into this message.

      When we find a field in `serialized` that is already present
      in this message:

      -   If it's a "repeated" field, we append to the end of our list.
      -   Else, if it's a scalar, we overwrite our field.
      -   Else, (it's a nonrepeated composite), we recursively merge
          into the existing composite.

      :param serialized: Any object that allows us to call
                         ``memoryview(serialized)`` to access a string of bytes using the
                         buffer interface.
      :type serialized: bytes

      :returns: The number of bytes read from `serialized`.
                For non-group messages, this will always be `len(serialized)`,
                but for messages which are actually groups, this will
                generally be less than `len(serialized)`, since we must
                stop when we reach an ``END_GROUP`` tag.  Note that if
                we *do* stop because of an ``END_GROUP`` tag, the number
                of bytes returned does not include the bytes
                for the ``END_GROUP`` tag information.
      :rtype: int

      :raises DecodeError: if the input cannot be parsed.



   .. py:method:: ParseFromString(serialized)

      Parse serialized protocol buffer data in binary form into this message.

      Like :func:`MergeFromString()`, except we clear the object first.

      :kwtype deterministic: bool

      :returns: A binary string representation of the message if all of the required
                fields in the message are set (i.e. the message is initialized).

      :raises EncodeError: if the message isn't initialized (see :func:`IsInitialized`).



   .. py:method:: SerializePartialToString(**kwargs)
      :abstractmethod:


      Serializes the protocol message to a binary string.

      This method is similar to SerializeToString but doesn't check if the
      message is initialized.

      :keyword deterministic: If true, requests deterministic serialization
                              of the protobuf, with predictable ordering of map keys.

   .. py:method:: ListFields()
      :abstractmethod:


      Returns a list of (FieldDescriptor, value) tuples for present fields.

      A message field is non-empty if HasField() would return true. A singular
      primitive field is non-empty if HasField() would return true in proto2 or it
      is non zero in proto3. A repeated field is non-empty if it contains at least
      one element. The fields are ordered by field number.

      :returns: field descriptors and values
                for all fields in the message which are not empty. The values vary by
                field type.
      :rtype: list[tuple(FieldDescriptor, value)]



   .. py:method:: HasField(field_name)
      :abstractmethod:


      Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

      For a oneof group, checks if any field inside is set. Note that if the
      field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, :exc:`ValueError` will
      be raised.

      :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.
      :type field_name: str

      :returns: Whether a value has been set for the named field.

      :raises ValueError: no group with the given name exists



   .. py:method:: HasExtension(field_descriptor)
      :abstractmethod:


      Checks if a certain extension is present for this message.

      Extensions are retrieved using the :attr:`Extensions` mapping (if present).

      :param field_descriptor: The field descriptor for the extension to check.

      :returns: Whether the extension is present for this message.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises KeyError: if the extension is repeated. Similar to repeated fields,
          there is no separate notion of presence: a "not present" repeated
          extension is an empty list.



   .. py:method:: ClearExtension(field_descriptor)
      :abstractmethod:


      Clears the contents of a given extension.

      :param field_descriptor: The field descriptor for the extension to clear.

      :abstractmethod:


      Internal method used by the protocol message implementation.
      Clients should not call this directly.

      Sets a listener that this message will call on certain state transitions.

      The purpose of this method is to register back-edges from children to
      parents at runtime, for the purpose of setting "has" bits and
      byte-size-dirty bits in the parent and ancestor objects whenever a child or
      descendant object is modified.

      If the client wants to disconnect this Message from the object tree, she
      explicitly sets callback to None.

      If message_listener is None, unregisters any existing listener.  Otherwise,
      message_listener must implement the MessageListener interface in
      internal/message_listener.py, and we discard any listener registered
      via a previous _SetListener() call.

         Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

         Has presence fields return true if the field is set, false if the field is
         not set. Fields without presence do raise `ValueError` (this includes
         repeated fields, map fields, and implicit presence fields).

         If field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, `ValueError` will
         be raised.

         :abstractmethod:


         Mark this as present in the parent.

         This normally happens automatically when you assign a field of a

         present while keeping it empty.  If you find yourself using this,
         you may want to reconsider your design.

         When we find a field in `serialized` that is already present

         :type serialized: bytes

         :returns: The number of bytes read from `serialized`.
                   For non-group messages, this will always be `len(serialized)`,
                   but for messages which are actually groups, this will
                   generally be less than `len(serialized)`, since we must
                   stop when we reach an ``END_GROUP`` tag.  Note that if
                   we *do* stop because of an ``END_GROUP`` tag, the number

         is non zero in proto3. A repeated field is non-empty if it contains at least
         one element. The fields are ordered by field number.

         :returns: field descriptors and values
                   for all fields in the message which are not empty. The values vary by

         Sets a listener that this message will call on certain state transitions.

         The purpose of this method is to register back-edges from children to
         parents at runtime, for the purpose of setting "has" bits and
         byte-size-dirty bits in the parent and ancestor objects whenever a child or
         descendant object is modified.

         If the client wants to disconnect this Message from the object tree, she
         explicitly sets callback to None.

         If message_listener is None, unregisters any existing listener.  Otherwise,
         message_listener must implement the MessageListener interface in
         internal/message_listener.py, and we discard any listener registered
         via a previous _SetListener() call.

   .. py:method:: _SetListener(message_listener)
      :abstractmethod:


      Internal method used by the protocol message implementation.
      Clients should not call this directly.

      Sets a listener that this message will call on certain state transitions.

      The purpose of this method is to register back-edges from children to
      parents at runtime, for the purpose of setting "has" bits and
      byte-size-dirty bits in the parent and ancestor objects whenever a child or
      descendant object is modified.

      If the client wants to disconnect this Message from the object tree, she
      explicitly sets callback to None.

      If message_listener is None, unregisters any existing listener.  Otherwise,
      message_listener must implement the MessageListener interface in
      internal/message_listener.py, and we discard any listener registered
      via a previous _SetListener() call.

      :abstractmethod:


      Merges the contents of the specified message into current message.

      This method merges the contents of the specified message into the current

      Clears all data that was set in the message.



   .. py:method:: SetInParent()
      :abstractmethod:


      Mark this as present in the parent.

      This normally happens automatically when you assign a field of a
      sub-message, but sometimes you want to make the sub-message
      present while keeping it empty.  If you find yourself using this,
      you may want to reconsider your design.



   .. py:method:: IsInitialized()

      :rtype: bool



   .. py:method:: MergeFromString(serialized)
      :abstractmethod:


      Merges serialized protocol buffer data into this message.

      When we find a field in `serialized` that is already present
      in this message:

      -   If it's a "repeated" field, we append to the end of our list.
      -   Else, if it's a scalar, we overwrite our field.
      -   Else, (it's a nonrepeated composite), we recursively merge
          into the existing composite.

                         buffer interface.
      :type serialized: bytes

      :returns: The number of bytes read from `serialized`.
                For non-group messages, this will always be `len(serialized)`,
                but for messages which are actually groups, this will
                generally be less than `len(serialized)`, since we must
                stop when we reach an ``END_GROUP`` tag.  Note that if
                we *do* stop because of an ``END_GROUP`` tag, the number
                of bytes returned does not include the bytes
                for the ``END_GROUP`` tag information.

      :param field_descriptor: The field descriptor for the extension to check.

      :returns: Whether the extension is present for this message.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises KeyError: if the extension is repeated. Similar to repeated fields,
